## Contributing

Please keep the [issue tracker](https://github.com/FluentDOM/FluentDOM/issues) limited to **bug reports**, **feature requests** and **pull requests**.


### Personal Support
If you have personal support or setup questions the best place to ask those is [Gitter](https://gitter.im/FluentDOM/FluentDOM). The answer
might take some time so please just ask. Longer question can be posted to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), please
link them in Gitter.


### Bug Reports
When reporting a bug make sure to include information about which browser and operating system you are on as well as 
the necessary steps to reproduce the issue.


### Pull Requests
- Should follow the coding style of the file you work in, most importantly:
  - 2 spaces to indent
  - Single-quoted strings
- Should be made towards the **master** branch
- Should be submitted from a **feature/topic** branch (not your **master**)


### Plugins
Please do not submit plugins as pull requests. They should be maintained in their own separate repository. 
More information here can be found in the [Plugin Guidelines](https://github.com/FluentDOM/FluentDOM/wiki/Plugin-Guidelines)
