This work is intended to provide some online source from which my family hompage
(currently running on protopage.com) can easily embed the Wikipedia Picture of
The Day ("POTD").

I thought of creating a low-content HTML page to embed on protopage, but using an
RSS feed gives me slightly better layout, so I'm going this way.

The resulting RSS feed will always have exactly one item, the most recent POTD.
