This work is intended to provide some online source from which my family hompage
(currently running on protonpage.com) can easily embed the Wikipedia Picture of
The Day.

I thought we would use an RSS feed, but creating a low-content HTML page gives
me a little more control over the layout and content (and this way I don't have 
to learn about RSS formats).
